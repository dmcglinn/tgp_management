[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/12820041.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/12820041)

Data and scripts for examining the fundamental basis of heterogenity-based management regiemes. Specifically we examine the importance of management using the variable application of fire relative to inherant sources of variation for explanaing patterns of plant community compositions and richness. 

To recreate the analyses of McGlinn & Palmer in press PeerJ run
the R script `./tgp_run_all.R`


The following R packages must be installed to run the code:

```r
install.packages(c('sp', 'vegan', 'car'))
```
