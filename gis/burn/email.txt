Pete,

Yes UTM NAD83, and the same goes for the attached updated 2004 burn data that includes all the burns both on and off TNC property.  Hopefully I will have the 2005 burn data finished sometime this week and I will send that to you ASAP.

-Matt

Matt,

Thanks!  Is the datum UTM NAD83 (versus NAD27)?
