Dan,

The Hubble Pasture was opened up to the herd on May 17, 2008.

That was easy!

Hey Bob,

Do you happen to have the date that the Hubble Pasture was added to the
bison unit?  The GIS shape files that Matt Poole provided indicate that
this took place in 2008 (and I think it was sometime in May) but if
possible it would be great to have an exact date.

Thanks and take care,
Dan
