Pete,

Here is the updated Bison Unit Pasture Boundary.  As always Shapefile
projection is UTM Nad 83.

We are wrapping up our summer burning season, 1 more unit left, so when
we finish it up, I will bump you an updated 2008 burn shapefile.

Hope your staying dry.

-Matt

Matt,

Have you updated the bison grazing shapefile to include the area added
this May?  If so, could you send it?  Thanks.
